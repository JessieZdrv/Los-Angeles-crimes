In this project, I worked with the "Los Angeles Crimes" dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to perform various visualizations to better understand the data and explore the relationships between different variables. By creating visual representations, I was able to gain insights into the distribution of crimes, victim demographics, and other relevant factors, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and patterns
